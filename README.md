# Expense-Tracker-C

- A Simple C Program which runs on basic mathematics.
- It takes income/expense with description from user as input.
- You can to total 10 entries of both income & expense, but you can obviously change that by increasing the size of MAX.
- At the end it gives user their savings.
- It also saves all the data in the .txt file with date and time.
